# Toggle Strikethrough Text <!-- omit in toc -->

Legislation can be hard to follow, especially when bills contain extensive strikethrough text for revisions. The Hide Strikethrough Text extension helps simplify South Dakota bills on [https://sdlegislature.gov/](https://sdlegislature.gov/) by allowing you to toggle strikethrough text on and off with a single click.

The legislative process often involves bills being amended 10+ times, leading to cluttered documents filled with strikethrough text that make it hard to quickly see what a bill actually does. I built this tool for my wife, [Nicole](https://www.nicoleforhouse.com), a Representative in the South Dakota State House, to help her cut through the noise and focus on the current version of a bill at a glance. If you work with legislation, I hope this makes your life a little easier too.

If you're in government, advocacy, or just want to better understand legislative changes, I hope this tool helps!
